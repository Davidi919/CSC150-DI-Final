# 🚀 Space Mission Planner

A program designed to help plan fictional space missions by calculating the optimal Hohmann transfer orbit between two planets. Using simplified Keplerian motion, the Space Mission Planner provides essential details such as travel time, orbital parameters, and a rough fuel estimate based on delta-v calculations.

## 🌌 Features

- **Planet Selection**: Choose a starting and destination planet from a predefined list (e.g., Earth, Mars, Venus, etc.).
- **Hohmann Transfer Calculations**: Determine the most efficient transfer orbit between two planets.
- **Delta-v and Fuel Estimation**: Calculate the delta-v required for the mission and provide a rough fuel estimate.
- **Mission Summary**: Present mission details, including:
  - Travel time
  - Key orbital parameters
  - Delta-v requirements
- **User-Friendly Output**: Easy-to-understand mission reports for planning fictional space missions.
